Various applications require 3D avatars that are realistic, artifact-free, and animatable. However, traditional 3D morphable models (3DMMs) produce animatable 3D heads but fail to capture accurate geometries and details, while existing deep implicit functions have been shown to achieve realistic reconstructions but suffer from artifacts and struggle to yield 3D heads that are easy to animate. To reconstruct **high-fidelity**, **artifact-less**, and **animatable** 3D heads from single images, we leverage dense semantics to bridge the best properties of 3DMMs and deep implicit functions and propose SeIF---a semantic-constrained deep implicit function. First, SeIF derives dense semantics from a standard 3DMM (e.g., FLAME) and samples a semantic code for each query point in the query space to provide a soft constraint to the deep implicit function. The reconstruction results show that this semantic constraint does not weaken the powerful representation ability of the deep implicit function while significantly suppressing artifacts. 
Second, SeIF predicts a more accurate semantic code for each query point and utilizes the semantic codes to uniformize the structure of reconstructed 3D head meshes with the standard 3DMM. Since our reconstructed 3D head meshes have the same structure as the 3DMM, 3DMM-based animation approaches can be easily transferred to animate our reconstructed 3D heads. As a result, SeIF can reconstruct high-fidelity, artifact-less, and animatable 3D heads from single images of individuals with diverse ages, genders, racesï¼Œ and facial expressions. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on seven datasets show that SeIF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

## Demos
This code has been tested with PyTorch 1.4.0 and CUDA 10.1. on Ubuntu 18.04.
We provide test code and pre-trained models. After installing the packages required for the project, run the following code:</br>
```objpython
python main_test.py
```
This code inputs the picture in the demo folder and outputs the 3D head model reconstructed from this picture. The corresponding results are saved in a demo folder. Such as input: demo/1.png, output: demo/1.obj. You can download [meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/#download) to view 3D models.</br>
